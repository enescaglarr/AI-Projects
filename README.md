## Project 1 - Customer Support Agent
This AI-powered customer support system utilizes a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to provide accurate, grounded responses to client inquiries. By integrating the Gemini API for both text embeddings and generation with a FAISS vector database, the application retrieves relevant historical data from a custom support dataset to inform its outputs. Built with Streamlit, the tool features an interactive interface where agents can refine AI-generated drafts in real-time, ensuring high-quality communication while reducing manual workload.
